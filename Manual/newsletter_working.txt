Based on the provided code snippets, it appears that the data inputted inside the newsletter form (`email` address) is handled on the client-side.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **newsletter.js**:
   - The `Newsletter` component contains a form where users can input their email address.
   - The `handleSubmit` function is triggered when the form is submitted. It checks if the email is not empty and contains an "@" symbol, then calls the `onValidated` function with the email data.
   - The `onValidated` function is passed as a prop to the `Newsletter` component from its parent component (`MailchimpForm`), which is responsible for handling the submission logic.

2. **mailchimp.js**:
   - The `MailchimpForm` component renders the `MailchimpSubscribe` component, passing the necessary props including the `subscribe` function.
   - The `subscribe` function is called with the form data (`formData`) when the form is submitted. This function is responsible for sending the email data to the Mailchimp server for subscription processing.

Therefore, the data inputted inside the newsletter form is initially handled on the client-side by validating the email address and then passed to the `MailchimpForm` component, which further sends it to the server (Mailchimp) for subscription processing.
